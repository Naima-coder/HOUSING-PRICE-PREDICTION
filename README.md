# HOUSING-PRICE-PREDICTION
HOUSE PRICE PREDICTION USING REGRESSION ANALYSIS
Introduction: 

House price estimation is a classical problem in the field of real estate. We know that house prices are important economic indicators of wealth and financial prosperity in an urban scenario. Accurately predicting house prices can improve decision making for homeowners looking to make long term investment and secure their future. House price estimation can also be used by real estate agents and companies to accurately value a home and provide competitive prices for potential home buyers. Typically, house-specific metrics like number of rooms, number of floors, lot area, built-up area, zip codes have shown to affect house valuation. One heuristic dataset commonly used for regression analysis of housing prices is the Boston suburban housing dataset. Former analyses have found that the prices of houses in that dataset are most strongly dependent on their size and the geographical location. Until recently, basic algorithms such as linear regression can achieve 0.113 prediction errors using both intrinsic features of the real estate properties (living area, number of rooms, etc.) and additional geographical features (socio demo-graphical features such as average income, population density, etc.). In this project, house prices will be predicted given explanatory variables that cover many aspects of residential houses. The goal of this project is to create a regression model that can accurately estimate the price of the house given the features. 

The project scope revolves around replicating an existing house price prediction model using simple linear regression and multivariant regression machine learning algorithms. The existing model dives into complex machine learning algorithms that will not be part of this study. In addition to that, the data set is limited to only key characteristics of a house related to housing condition like bedrooms, number of floors, square feet, year built, zip code, longitude and latitude, etc. The data set does not include neighborhood effects like taxation policies, availability of transportation and social and economic factors like schools, pollution levels, crime rates, etc. I am implemented the algorithm to provide deliverable inform, data set, and graphical representation of performance evaluation of machine learning algorithms. 

The crucial element in machine learning task for which an attention should be clearly taken is the data. Indeed, the results will be highly influenced by the data based on how we found them, how are they formatted, are they consistent, is there any outliers and so on. This project  using California housing dataset with ten attribute which is collected from kaggle. As part of processing the data, I have performed cleaning, formatting, removal of outliers and data scaling. Once the data is ready to be fed into machine learning algorithm, I have split the data into train and test and used regression algorithm to predict the housing price. I have have used Linear and multiple variable linear regression algorithm to make a model which can give us a good prediction on the price of the house based on attributes. 
Problem Statement : 

 Housing prices are an important reflection of the economy, and housing price ranges are of great interest for both buyers and sellers. If a home buyer is asked to describe their dream house, they probably wonâ€™t begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. To sell a house, we need to know what price tag to put on. 

The problem I am going to solve in this project is the house price prediction problem. Based on certain features of the house, such as the area in square feet, number of bedrooms, population in area, number of floors, year of built, I have to predict the estimated price of the house. The dataset attributes prove that much more influences of attributes on house price. With 10 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in California, the regression algorithm is used to predict the final price of each home
Objective and Scope 

The aim of this project is to build a machine learning model to predict house prices and evaluate the performance of algorithms.  

Objectives: 

    Data set will be extracted from an existing model and will be investigated to identify different features by plotting them to determine the relationship to house price and discover the correlations between features. 

    The data will be verified for missing or incomplete data as part of data cleaning. 

    The data will be normalized to mitigate any skewedness and achieve normal distribution curve. 

    Apply machine learning algorithms like linear regression, multiple linear regression and random forest regression to predict house prices and evaluate the performance using mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE) and R squared value.
